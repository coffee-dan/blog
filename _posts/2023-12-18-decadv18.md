Cat hotel and some args testing

Improved help menu with reasonable description and created --fen initialization arg. This is perhaps is not that usable of a feature but it is helpful for testing out cobra as a set of tools for command-line args.

I now have two visiting cats at my place, so it's been every so slightly hectic.
