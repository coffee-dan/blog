Christmas eve eve

I found SSH to be quite a bit too complicated for what I am doing. Started with simplest possible approach. I asked ChatGPT what the lowest possible complexity multiplayer system would be. That appears to be blasting data across UDP with low latency and reckless abandon. No. So I will be using TCP with one user as the server and the other as the client (?). For the time being this will require both ends being highly available systems with absolutely no disconnects.
