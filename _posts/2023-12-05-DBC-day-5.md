    * ![chess board inside terminal with B1 as player input and the potential moves for the knight at the position highlighted, proving the new feature works](/assets/dbc-day-5-possible-move-highlights.png)

Notes:
* Got home later than usual so perhaps another day will be even better than this
* Have a date planned for Thursday this week so perhaps that day will be kinda lost, not sure how to handle days like this within the "December Build Club" or i guess "December Adventure"
* Red wine was good, got it from Whole Foods on a whim cause I was there for an Amazon package

Next:
