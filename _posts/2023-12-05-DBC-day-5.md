* Implmented first and second character highlighting as described in day 4 second
    * one character/rune filters to pieces in that column
    * two characters/runes filers to possibles moves for that specific piece
* Updated colors used by highlighting to not be eye-searing without straying too far from the base ANSI color set

* Got home later than usual so perhaps another day will be even better than this
* Have a date planned for Thursday this week so perhaps that day will be kinda lost
