Four tomatoes, more PBR

## Wins

Four (4) whole pomodoro timers worth of work.

Fixed board flipping such that it is good enough to move on.

## Notes

It seems like viewports are not the right choice for all the UI elements that I am using them for. A viewport is essentially a bubbletea implementation of a terminal pager. This is not appropriate for elements that wont be changing size and/or should not vertically scroll and is likely the source of the autocomplete display woes.

## Next

1. autocomplete
    * guess menu cuts off for long lists, namely the queen
    * guess menu tab-ing does not work when list is only one move long
2. command line args that accept FEN string for board init
    * consider using cobra and/or viper (cli args tooling)
10. credits
    * series of pages that can be flipped through with ascii art representing each direct dependency author
99. highlighting
    * is there a way to access the boards in a different way rather than modifying the entire thing on each tick?
