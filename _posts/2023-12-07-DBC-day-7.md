On the imprecise semantics of a day on Earth, deleting master, and other administrative tasks

# Day 7?

Wins:
* The blog now has syntax highlighting!

    ```go
    html, ok := markdown.renderWithHighlights()
    if !ok {
        panic("Something happened :/")
    }
    // html declared and not used compiler(UnusedVar)
    ```

* Resolved build errors in Github actions by removing dependency on "slices" package which was definitely a 2am solution that I might have to find a real solution for later
    * but Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯
* Renamed master -> main for blog repo
    * finally got convinced this is correct because it
        * a: does not fit the database master-slave process pattern of thinking/behavior
            * neither the origin/main nor the production/main dictate the behavior of local main
        * b: does not fit the music industry master record model (the definitive copy)
            * "definitive" is a weird way to describe something that can change daily including forward and backward changes
        * it's a dang misnomer
        * now just a few years before i start insisting upon trunk :0)

Notes:
* a day is what fits your perception of a day
    * sometimes a lot happens in a day with clear dividing lines and i think that is two days
    * sometimes you stay up very late and the boundary of the day is extended by a lot
        * as you may have guessed i stayed up until like 4am and slept before i could post :--)
* Blog things
    * would like to have DBC show up as an acronym
    * probably need spellcheck for markdown files
* General things
    * asap gonna start working on building a PC (linux) for the first time wowowowow
        * so slightly less time for coding, but then i will be on winter PTO so it shakes out. double december adventure_!_

Next:
* continue work on highlighting
* think about auto complete system
* design work
    * decide on product for this, need to consider ASCII limitation and might have to avoid a general design software like miro/figma/etc.
    * design validation system (layout/style/content)
    * design menus (restart/exit/game setup)
