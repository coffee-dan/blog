# Day 8

Wins:
* Using Pomodoro to keep on keep late night coding from turning into mental dead ends
    * smart watch is actually just fine for this, sound is not ideal, visuals can be distracting but a timer on the watch is great cause you can always check to remind yourself but it's not going to remind you until it's done.
* Highlighting is MDP (Minimum dog foodable product)
    * i can live with this level of highlighting behavior

Notes:
* Need to find a decent workflow for creating gifs to show of the highlighting

Next:
* auto-complete for moves of all types
    * should assist with situations like:
        * named pieces `b1c3` tab -> `Nb1c3`
        * captures `e4d5` tab -> `e4xd5`
    * thinking of a system where on each input change the system recalculates autocomplete candidates
        * renders as tab-navigable list
        * ranked? based on something

* design work
    * decide on product for this, need to consider ASCII limitation and might have to avoid a general design software like miro/figma/etc.
    * design validation system (layout/style/content)
    * design menus (restart/exit/game setup)
