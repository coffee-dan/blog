# Day 8

Wins:
* Using Pomodoro to keep on keep late night coding from turning into mental dead ends
    * smart watch is actually just fine for this, sound is not ideal, visuals can be distracting but a timer on the watch is great cause you can always check to remind yourself but it's not going to remind you until it's done.

Notes:
*

Next:
* continue work on highlighting
* think about auto complete system
* design work
    * decide on product for this, need to consider ASCII limitation and might have to avoid a general design software like miro/figma/etc.
    * design validation system (layout/style/content)
    * design menus (restart/exit/game setup)
