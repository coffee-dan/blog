Christmas movies and SSH overwhelm

![Bubble chess menu glitching because menu and game were both receiving input at the same time](/assets/decadv-day-22-glitchy-menu.gif)

This is why I had to change things.

I implemented switching between main menu and game via a `mode` attribute on a singular bubbletea "program". This seems very obviously not scalable but I don't know the typical game dev wisdom yet. I also added a simple credits gallery for ascii art plus a description about why I want to credit the author(s). I am slightly overwhelmed but generally looking forward to researching multiplayer/SSH. I have never worked with the problem-space or tech before so it is very exciting!
