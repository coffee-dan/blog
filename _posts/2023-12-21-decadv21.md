Crunch and amaretto sour

Implemented a simple menuItem type with `action` callbacks. Tried to work on the transition between the menu and the game itself. Ended up stuck on a confusion combination of `tea.Sequence` and `tea.Batch`. I will keep trying on the transition back and forth between two bubbletea "programs" until I bump up against a concrete problem.

Working on actually writing on the same day I do the work.
