Net chat and red lager

I've finally scoped down the TCP communication project enough such that I am not distracted by implementation details. That is what was happening with net-tic-tac-toe. I think that tic-tac-toe is worth returning to only after I've gotten a grip on chat. I've found it is exceedingly difficult when testing on the same machine since each side of the exchange must know some semblance of a unique address for the other. My best approach for that has been using a unique localhost port for each user.

Regarding the alcohol consumption. I think this is an ever-present part of the process because I am hoping to reduce inhibition. There are moments where I need mental clarity to think about what I will do and how I will do it. However, the act of execution when stakes are this low does not require clarity. It does greatly benefit from the willingness to be wrong quickly. And I think drunk people, myself included, are quite good at being wrong.

Also the red lager is not that good. Cannot all be winners.
