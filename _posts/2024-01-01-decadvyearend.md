News year

(had time to work on proj but not time to write)

I spent probably two hours across the two days writing out some starter code for the relay server. The very minimum requirement for this idea is the relay listening at localhost:3030 for messages sent from either `addr1` or `addr2` and forwarding the message to the correct address based on headers provided in the original message. For now this is using TCP/JSON since HTTP seems a bit too complex for what this system needs.

All said and done I have a buggy single player chess game, a wip multiplayer tic-tac-toe game, and a better understanding of Go. This was a nice project and I plan to keep the project/process going with some changes.

First, I plan to set a time limit whereafter I must be done with all basic tasks for the day. That includes administrative stuff (taxes, checking email, etc), health stuff (gym, dinner, etc) AND project time. This is important because it's a marathon not a race. I cannot justify messing up my sleep schedule just because my day schedule got out of wack. The closest analog for this is the "wind down" concept that my smart watch is always complaining to me about.

Second, I plan to leave the project on hold after multiplayer is done. I will not set up a persistent game server. I will not obsess over ever single last bug. I will not publish to homebrew (even though I original had this as a goal, I just don't think it is ready and `go install` is a decent enough experience). I will call this version the 1.0 and move on to new exciting projects so that I can learn more about the terminal/ascii art/games/networking.

Thank you December Adventure
