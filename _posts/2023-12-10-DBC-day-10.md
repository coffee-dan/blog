I woke up hungover. Slept until 4pm, handled an incident for my dayjob, slept until 8pm.

## Wins

Cranked out [feature: naive move auto complete suggestion list](https://github.com/coffee-dan/bubble-chess/commit/7a76d41c558f5a5e9914928e84450511fd835931) and I'm pretty happy with the results. Here's some muscle memory kicking in where I know I would like to hit tab to complete the move command.

## Notes

I've been looking at some other sites that are doing DecemberAdventure and wow do these folks know how to style a blog site. Ex:
- [varvara zine](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/varvara.html)
- [100rabbits](https://rabbits.srht.site/decadv/)
- [Arcade Wise](https://arcades.agency/index.html)

A couple of these sites use a template that I really like. It gives this feeling that there is a lot to discover on the site but it the entire site does not reveal itself to you at first blush. You have to actually crawl through the hyperlinks. And as a side note I noticed a few of these folks use C and do low-level stuffs.

## Next

1. tab auto-complete
    * allow user to cycle through guess menu using tab and make sure to update the highlights as this happens
2. design work
    * pen and grid paper
    * design validation system (layout/style/content)
    * design menus (restart/exit/game setup)
        * downwell, vitetris, galaga, etc.
