All talk no code

I worked through game communication with a friend. It seems like I can have the best of both worlds where there is a long term server running on my domain chess.danielramirez.xyz/server and an option to host a server when starting a game.

```sh
# join main server to search for a game
bchess
# host server (this is for my own and for player servers)
bchess serve
```

```sh
# host server and join your own server
# requires port forwarding or playing on the same network
bchess --host-at=PORT
# connect to player server
bchess --connect=HOSTNAME:PORT
```
