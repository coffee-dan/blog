Only forward

I put together a simple menu that doesn't work yet, but decided to commit it since this project is not about taking one safe step at a time. No one is relying on this software! No midnight incident calls. No production issues. This is for fun and is expected to break at minium once per session. It's a great thing to see things progressing fast.

On top of that I have decided to learn to do ASCII art the right way so these things will have a bit of soul to them and cause it seems fun.
