It is possible to traverse the guess menu and have it behavior in a relatively intuitive way. Three cheers for the naive approach to things. Is it wrong? Yeah! Can I fix it? Yeah!

## Notes

Really got a good unstanding of just how simple old-school menu systems are. It's just a list, a bounding box, and a pointer. Everything else is interaction and render logic. Feels amazing in comparison to centering divs.

Red wine is a 2020 bottle and I think this is very funny.

## Next

1. tab auto-complete
    * behavior after choice is made is very jank, this is expected because the string representation is directly fed into the input box and the string interpretting is using a non-production ready method

2. rethink the need for designing?? it seems like i've been fine just winging it, perhaps i don't need to intellectualize about the placement of runes until after the game is 75% done
