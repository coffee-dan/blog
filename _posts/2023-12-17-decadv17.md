Visiting friends, friends visiting, and some code

I made a minor refactor, replaced a usage of `viewport.Model` with `string`. I think it's a small win that points towards actually understanding what these components are for, when they should be used and what to reach for otherwise. In this case `guessMenu` is a cached rendering of `guessList` (perhaps not the best naming convention) so it can be as simple as a string.

Had a super busy day so I knocked out at 7:30pm with not a spare second to consider writing about what I had done early that day (at time of writing it is dec18 11:53pm).
