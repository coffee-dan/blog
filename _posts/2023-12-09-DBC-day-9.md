What is the minimal amount of work for a productive day? How should this be measured? This is my way of saying I wasn't able to do much.

## Wins

I worked on [refactor: move []chess.Square -> bitboard to func](https://github.com/coffee-dan/bubble-chess/commit/a273b127f58f609e97781bcc0656fee6d9672fc9) and happened to not actually commit/push it until time of writing, Mon Dec 11 12:XX AM.

This was pretty rewarding as it was a snippet of code I had theorized was possible for a while but did not actually write until I felt the highlighting feature was done.

## Notes

A lot of my time on this day was absorbed with preparing for having guests over, so cleaning, last minute shopping, cooking, etc. All said this was a good day even if I didn't finish the whole game in one night. Although it did result in me being _very_ hungover on day 10. üòµ‚Äçüí´

## Next

1. auto-complete for moves of all types
2. design work
    * pen and grid paper
    * design validation system (layout/style/content)
    * design menus (restart/exit/game setup)
        * downwell, vitetris, galaga, etc.
