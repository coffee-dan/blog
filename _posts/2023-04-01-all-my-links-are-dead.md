Today I Learned: all my links are dead

## What links?

My old portfolio website linked out to a couple personal projects and to an academic project.

- Netflix Zero, a clone of Netflix, got banned from Firebase for being too suspected of phishing.
- React Startpage, a knowledge base, got quietly spun down because Netlify up-dated their stack causing my deployment to be incompatible
- UTA Nursing VR, a project page for University of Texas at Arlington's hospice care VR simulation, got quietly removed from their website with no stated reason

## My Honest Reaction

I took down the entire website and did not replace anything.

## What's next?

This blog.
