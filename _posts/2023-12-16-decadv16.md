Writing on busy day, lipstick on a pig, and putting the pig on a diet

## Wins

New layout

I narrowed the core model down to only the major UI elements, which freed up a lot of space for exploring a new layout. As well I found I had been using bubbles/textarea for the absolute wrong component. I replaced this with bubbles/textinput and was able to remove most of the upfront configuration.

## Notes

The next two weeks are going to be very very busy, but today gives me hope that I will be able to work everyday. Unfortunately the writing suffers a bit. I can easily justify some laser-focused Pomodoros but writing for an indefinite time is similarly easy to drop for the sake of time. I think this points toward a need for a leaner template:
- Next goes in a different location, a general status page for the proj
    - I end up copy-pasting the Next list between posts
- The post proper has no titles and is instead just a few paragraphs
    - This reduces everything to a few minutes of writing and then a possible video-to-gif conversion

## Next

1. autocomplete
    * guess menu tab-ing does not work when list is only one move long
2. command line args that accept FEN string for board init
    * consider using cobra and/or viper (cli args tooling)
10. credits
    * series of pages that can be flipped through with ascii art representing each direct dependency author
99. highlighting
    * is there a way to access the boards in a different way rather than modifying the entire thing on each tick?
