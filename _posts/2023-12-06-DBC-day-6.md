Cat coding companion, func born to die, commit to move on

# Day 5

Wins:
* Finished three-rune highlighting
    * `b1c` highlights the B-file knight's right hand move
* Started single-rune piece-type highlighting
    * `N` highlights all knights
* Determined lots of my rough draft code will be replaced soon!
    * I've gotten good at writing functions quickly to express the idea in my head so that as my understanding of the goal/problem improves I can rip up the funcs laid down right behind me to place new funcs in front of me.
    * This likely looks like a intuitive understanding of the "don't prematurely optimize" nugget of wisdom.

Notes:
* My cat decided to sleep next to me while I'm writing tonight, look at him
    * ![a very normal looking cat sleeping on a grey blanket](/assets/dbc-day-6-gus.png)
* Some func-y Golang stuff is going on
    * CI pipeline cannot build project for some reason. Devoops
        * Which on that note I don't have any tests at the moment, that might be worth addressing soon

Next:
* continue work on highlighting
    * named moves need to mesh into the existing one-two-three rune highlighting progression
* think about auto complete system
    * seems like the easiest way to convey non-obvious movements like capturing, assisting users with including piece names in their move command
    * really like the zsh behavior for tabbing between possible options where each option updates the content of the command line as you select
        * `cd ` and then tab tab tab
* design work
    * miro?
    * design validation system (layout/style/content)
    * design menus (restart/exit/game setup)
